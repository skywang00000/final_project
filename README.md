## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking
This project provides a visual demonstration of the binary search algorithm. First, I divided this complex problem into six sub-tasks: input validation, array sorting check, pointer initialization, loop comparison, result recording, and user interface interaction. In the 'pattern recognition' stage, I identified the core patterns of the algorithm—the regularity of the search range halving after each comparison, and the deterministic behavior of the pointer moving left or right based on the comparison result. Next, I performed 'abstraction,' selecting to show users key information (such as changes in the search range, comparisons of intermediate values, and pointer movement direction) to focus the learning on the algorithm's logic rather than implementation details. Finally, by constructing a complete workflow—for example, the user provides input through a graphical interface, the program validates and processes it, and then presents the search process step-by-step, forming a clear teaching loop. This structured thinking process not only ensures the correctness of the code but also makes the final application educational, effectively helping users understand the working principle of binary search.

## AI Declainer: 
I also relied on AI to help me complete this project. Since Gradio was a language I was new to, there were many libraries I didn't know. However, the binary search code was entirely handwritten by me.
